# 🎵 Music & Mental Health Analysis  

**Exploring the relationship between music preferences, listening habits, and self-reported mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD).**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes survey data on music consumption and mental health to identify patterns and correlations. The study includes **statistical analysis, clustering, and regression modeling** to uncover potential links between music habits and psychological well-being.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Pearson/Spearman correlations, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA, Chi-square tests  
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means Clustering, OLS Regression (Statsmodels)  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Listening time** is weakly correlated with **higher depression, insomnia, and OCD**.  
- **Genre impact is minor**: Folk, Hip-hop, and Lofi show slightly higher anxiety/depression, while Classical and Rap correlate with lower insomnia.  
- **Three mental health clusters** were identified via **K-Means Clustering**.  
- **Music's self-reported effect** varies: 75% say it improves their state, 2.3% report worsening.  

## 🚀 Applications  
- **Music therapy insights** for anxiety, depression & sleep disorders.  
- **Personalized music recommendations** based on mental health.  
- **Further research** into causation vs. correlation in music psychology.
